can Handel Missing value in some ways\n","Here's how these methods can be used to handle missing values:\n","\n","* Mean Imputation: This method replaces missing values with the mean of the available data for that feature. It works well when the missing values are missing completely at random (MCAR) or missing at random (MAR). By using the mean, you preserve the overall central tendency of the feature.\n","\n","* Median Imputation: Similar to mean imputation, median imputation replaces missing values with the median of the available data. It is more robust to outliers compared to the mean. This method is useful when the feature has a skewed distribution or contains outliers.\n","\n","* Mode Imputation: Mode imputation is applicable for categorical or nominal features. It replaces missing values with the most frequent category (mode) observed in the data. This method is suitable when the missing values are sparse and the mode provides a reasonable estimate of the missing values.\n","\n","* Frequency-Based Imputation: In this approach, missing values are replaced with values based on their frequency of occurrence in the dataset. For example, you could replace missing values with the most frequent value or randomly sample values from the distribution of observed values, considering their frequency."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"id":"dbfb3694","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-28T18:56:30.994998Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-28T18:56:30.994547Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-28T18:56:31.056419Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-28T18:56:31.054728Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.076075,"end_time":"2023-05-28T18:56:31.059653","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-05-28T18:56:30.983578","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["
